known issues:
- spamming "=" button when substracting or dividing doesnt work properly
- validation message showing repeatedly too quickly causes visual glitches
- using . (comma) when writing directly in the input box with a keyboard isnt possible, and inserting some symbols like "+" to the input box resets its content
